                A low-fat, high-fiber diet can significantly reduce estrogen
                levels.5,6 Cancer researchers have taken great interest in this
                phenomenon because lowering the level of estrogen in the blood
                helps reduce the risk of breast cancer. Less estrogen means less
                stimulation for cancer cell growth.
                <br />
                <br />
                If a woman eating a Western diet cuts her fat intake in half,
                her estrogen level will be about 17% lower. If the amount of fat
                is cut even more, the estrogen level will drop further. A lower
                hormone level will have less effect on the uterine cells.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to lowering estrogen, a low-fat diet may also be
                beneficial because high-fiber vegetables, beans, fruits, and
                whole grains help the body to eliminate estrogens. Estrogen is
                normally pulled from the bloodstream by the liver, which sends
                it through a small tube, called the bile duct, into the
                intestinal tract. There, fiber soaks it up like a sponge and
                carries it out with other waste. The more fiber in the diet, the
                better the natural “estrogen disposal system” works.
                <br /><br />
                Animal products and many processed foods do not contain fiber.
                When an individual's diet consists predominantly of packaged
                foods, refined grains, meat, or dairy, daily fiber needs may not
                be met. The extra estrogens, which should bind to fiber in the
                digestive tract and leave the body, get absorbed back into the
                bloodstream. This hormone “recycling” increases the amount of
                estrogen in the blood.
                <br /><br />
                However, the reabsorption of estrogens can be blocked with the
                fiber found in grains, vegetables, beans, and other plant foods.
                When researchers asked women in Japan what foods they ate most
                often and how they would rate their menstrual pain, they found
                that eating high amounts of fiber was significantly related to
                having less menstrual pain. By blocking the reabsorption of
                estrogen, fiber helps to reduce estrogen levels and subsequent
                menstrual cramps.
                <br /><br />
                Not only do animal products lack fiber, but they also can
                contribute to worse menstrual pain. A study showed that higher
                intakes of red meat and processed meat may lead to
                endometriosis—a painful condition in which uterine cells extend
                to other organs in the body. The women who ate the most red meat
                (more than two servings a day) increased their risk of
                developing endometriosis by as much as 56%. In addition, dairy
                products may contribute to extra estrogen circulating in the
                blood since cows are usually pregnant while being milked and may
                pass along estrogen through their milk.
                <br /><br />
                By avoiding animal products, processed foods, and added oils,
                estrogen production is reduced. And by replacing chicken, skim
                milk, and other nonfiber foods with grains, beans, and
                vegetables, estrogen elimination is increased.
                <br /><br />
                In a research study published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, a
                low-fat, vegan diet significantly reduced pain and PMS for many
                women. The study included 33 women who followed either the
                low-fat vegan diet or their regular diet and then switched
                treatments. The diet change was designed to do two things.
                First, it eliminated all animal fats and nearly all vegetable
                oils. Second, its emphasis on plant-based foods increased the
                fiber in the diet. While these women followed the low-fat vegan
                diet, the intensity of their pain was significantly lower than
                during their regular diet. They also noticed less water
                retention and fewer mood swings. The effect of the diet was so
                powerful that some women refused to switch back to their regular
                diet, even though the study design required it.

                  This may sound like a significant change, but eliminating
                  foods slowly over the course of a few days can make the change
                  easier. Experiment with new foods and try to get family
                  members, friends, and partners involved in recipe tasting. You
                  may notice many benefits over the course of your next
                  menstrual cycles, including reduced menstrual cramps, weight
                  loss, and increased energy. This sense of relief can be
                  rewarding to many women. In order to prevent unwanted
                  menstrual cramps or other symptoms, avoiding all animal
                  products and oily foods is important. Eat foods in their
                  natural state, such as brown rice instead of white rice and
                  whole-grain bread instead of white bread, to make sure you
                  consume all their nutrients and fiber content. Try out eating
                  this way to see if it changes your next few cycles and learn
                  how something as simple as changing your diet can lead to
                  powerful improvements in your health.
